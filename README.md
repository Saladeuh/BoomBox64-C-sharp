# Boom Box 64 console
Here is a little study project which was â€“ as the title saidÂ  â€“ to reproduce the Boom Box minigame from Super Mario 64 DS as a light computer game.
Thatâ€™s just a pairing audio minigame. There is 6 or 8 boxes (mapped on keyboard numbers) nd all play a sound when opened. The goal is to pair them in with a limit of tries.
You can edit sounds in the Content directory, but keep in mind that I don't fix any limit about what you can put in it.
